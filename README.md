# deno-crash-course
This is a repo I created during the time I was playing with Deno, the new JavaScript runtime.

## How to Start
This project uses Denon.

### How to Install Denon
To install Denon visit their official page at `https://deno.land/x/denon`

To start the rest API
```
cd rest_api && denon start
```

## Postgres Credentials
DB credentials exist in the file `config.ts`. Upadate the file with your own DB credentials.
